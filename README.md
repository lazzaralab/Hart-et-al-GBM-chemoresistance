The repository for the manuscript Hart, et al, "The tumor microenvironment drives unexpected changes to glioblastoma cell chemoresistance via PTEN and MYC."

## Running the Code
There are two R scripts used to generate the figures in Hart, et al. 
1) Luminex_PLSR.Rmd - this script is used to perform PLSR and other analyses of Luminex and cell death data
2) GBM_chemoresistance_figures.Rmd - this script contains all the code to generate plots in the manuscript
